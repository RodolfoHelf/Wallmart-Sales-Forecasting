# Walmart Sales Forecasting Dashboard – Project Proposal & PACE Strategy

## Project Objective
Develop a machine learning-powered sales forecasting dashboard for Walmart's South Atlantic Division to improve weekly forecast accuracy, reduce stockouts and markdowns, and enable data-driven decisions for merchandising, supply chain, and finance teams.

## Technical Architecture

### **Technology Stack**
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI for high-performance API
- **Machine Learning**: MLflow for model versioning and experiment tracking
- **Monitoring**: MLflow for experiment tracking and model monitoring
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn for data science workflows
- **Forecasting Models**: SARIMAX, Prophet, LightGBM, XGBoost
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn for interactive charts
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM

## PACE Strategy

### **P – Plan**
**Summary:** Define the scope, identify data needs, and design the workflow to ensure a successful outcome.  
**Key Activities:**  
- Research Walmart's operational and merchandising data needs  
- Define project scope (Store x Department forecasts, 1–12 week horizon, holiday sensitivity)  
- Develop project workflow with milestones and timelines  
- Assess stakeholder requirements across Merchandising, Supply Chain, and Finance  
- Identify potential risks (data quality, holiday volatility, external factors like weather)  

**Planned Deliverables:**  
- Project plan document  
- Data source inventory (historical sales, weather, CPI, unemployment, holidays)  
- Stakeholder requirements document  

---

### **A – Analyze**
**Summary:** Acquire, clean, and prepare data for modeling.  
**Key Activities:**  
- Gather historical sales and external drivers (weather, fuel price, CPI, unemployment)  
- Integrate holiday/event calendar  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends, seasonality, and anomalies  
- Clean and format data for modeling  
- Engineer relevant features (rolling averages, lag variables, holiday flags)  

**Planned Deliverables:**  
- Cleaned and structured dataset  
- EDA report with visualizations and insights  
- Feature engineering documentation  

---

### **C – Construct**
**Summary:** Build, train, and evaluate forecasting models to meet accuracy targets.  
**Key Activities:**  
- Select appropriate modeling approaches (SARIMAX, LightGBM, XGBoost, Prophet)  
- Train hierarchical models for Store x Department forecasts  
- Incorporate external regressors for holiday and economic impact  
- Validate models using MAPE, WAPE, and bias metrics  
- Perform backtesting with rolling origin validation  

**Planned Deliverables:**  
- Model training scripts and configuration files  
- Model performance benchmark report  
- Forecast Value Add (FVA) comparison against naive baseline  

---

### **E – Execute**
**Summary:** Deploy the forecasting solution, share results, and iterate based on feedback.  
**Key Activities:**  
- Develop FastAPI dashboard with interactive filters, KPIs, and forecast charts  
- Integrate model outputs into the dashboard with automatic weekly refresh  
- Present findings to stakeholders (executives, category managers, planners)  
- Gather feedback and incorporate into dashboard enhancements  
- Train stakeholders on dashboard use and interpretation  

**Planned Deliverables:**  
- Live operational FastAPI dashboard  
- Executive summary report  
- Post-implementation review  

---

## Communication Across PACE
Communication will be continuous at every stage:  
- Regular stakeholder updates during Planning and Analysis  
- Cross-team collaboration during data preparation and modeling  
- Review sessions during Execution to align on insights and adjustments  
- Feedback loops for model improvement and dashboard feature enhancements  

---

## Adaptability of PACE
The PACE model will be applied flexibly:  
- If unexpected data issues arise, revisit **Analyze** without halting progress  
- If new KPIs are requested, loop back to **Plan** and adjust scope  
- If models need tuning after feedback, re-enter **Construct** before re-executing
